Dropping `propTypes` and `defaultProps` no longer supported by React 19 and long deprecated in React 18 (going forward, use TypeScript for prop typings, and if necessary, a runtime library to validate props); Increasing minimum supported React version up to >=18; Bumping `focus-trap` dependency to v7.6.2
